# Ramadan Schedule Converter

## Overview  
**Ramadan Schedule Converter** is a web application designed for **Umm Al-Qura University** students to easily convert their regular academic schedules into Ramadan-adjusted timetables. This tool automates the process of recalculating class times according to the university's official Ramadan schedule, saving students time and preventing confusion during the holy month.

## Features
- 🎯 **Intuitive Interface**: Simple and user-friendly design for easy schedule input  
- 👨‍🎓👩‍🎓 **Gender-Specific Schedules**: Support for both male and female student timetables, which follow different period structures  
- ➕ **Flexible Course Entry**: Add multiple courses for each day of the week  
- ⏱️ **Period Type Options**: Support for both single (50-minute) and double (100-minute) consecutive periods  
- 📘 **Course Type Designation**: Distinguish between theoretical and practical classes  
- 📅 **Visual Timetable Output**: Clean, color-coded display of the converted Ramadan schedule  
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices  

## How It Works
1. Users select their student type (male/female)  
2. They enter their regular course information:
   - Course name  
   - Day of the week  
   - Period (single or double consecutive)  
   - Time slot  
   - Course type (theoretical or practical)  
3. Upon submission, the application converts the regular schedule to Ramadan timing based on the university's official conversion table  
4. The converted schedule is displayed in an easy-to-read grid format with color-coded course types  

## Technical Details
